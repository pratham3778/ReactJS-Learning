- To divide user interface in react we have to create component
- component first latter capital(convention)
- give extension as .jsx to make it show that we have created it and not react(which comes in by default .js extension). 
- Basically it shows user defined component
- JSX : Javascript xml(xtensible markup lang)
- built-in component(.js)
- User Defined Component(.jsx)

Benefits of JSX
- UI and Dynamic code in 1 file
- supports jsx expression"{}" for dynamic coding inside markup or UI
- it indicates user defined component
